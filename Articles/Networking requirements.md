# Insight Agent requirements - network traffic and connectivity

In order for the Insight Agent to successfully transmit data between the asset on which it is installed and the Insight Platform, your network must allow communication with a variety of endpoints through specific network ports based on the Rapid7 data storage region to which your organization is subscribed. Additionally, your network must allow agent-related data in transit to reach the Insight Platform without undergoing decryption or any other process that modifies the data from the format Rapid7 services are expecting.

This article covers all network traffic and connectivity requirements you need to be aware of, along with other common network scenarios that could impact the functionality of your agent deployment.
