# Writing sample - OpenAPI specification for an example API

> I wrote `example-service-api.yaml` to demonstrate my understanding of the OpenAPI Specification. The "Example Service" API that it documents does not really exist, but I designed it to showcase how I format and populate OpenAPI objects and make use of shared references.
>
> The API is composed of 3 resources called `Things`, `Relationships`, and `Accounts`. I've documented several theoretical operations for each resource, and each of these includes authentication instructions, parameter and schema details, and samples for requests, payloads, and responses.
>
> You can generate a preview of these API docs using the [Redocly CLI](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/), or import the documentation into tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and [SwaggerUI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui).
