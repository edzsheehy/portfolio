# Skills portfolio by Edward Sheehy

This repository contains samples of my technical writing, UX writing, content design, and style guide work. I've included contextual information with each sample (appearing as block quotes) to explain the reasoning behind the content and the process I used. These samples include:

*  Articles I've written for enterprise cybersecurity software features, infrastructure components, and technical tasks.
   *  Each of the articles in this repository appear as I wrote them originally. I've provided links to the currently published editions when possible, but these may appear different from the repository editions.
*  Release notes for product changes.
*  A theoretical OpenAPI 3.0 specification.
*  Style guides for an internal audience on a variety of writing scenarios.
