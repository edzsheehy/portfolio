# Skills portfolio by Edward Sheehy

This repository contains samples of my technical writing, UX writing, content design, and style guide work. I've included contextual information with each sample (appearing as block quotes) to explain the reasoning behind the content and the process I used. These samples include:

*  Articles I've written for enterprise cybersecurity software features, infrastructure components, and technical tasks.
*  Release notes for product changes.
*  A theoretical OpenAPI 3.0 specification.
*  Style guides for an internal audience on a variety of writing use cases.

Aside from writing, I have also included examples that demonstrate my understanding of several computer languages:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* SQL
