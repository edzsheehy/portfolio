# Writing samples by Edward Sheehy

This repository contains samples of my technical writing, UX writing, content design, and style guide work. I've included contextual information with each sample to explain the reasoning behind the content and the process I used to write it. These samples include:

*  Articles I've written for enterprise cybersecurity software features, infrastructure components, and technical tasks.
*  Release notes for product changes.
*  A theoretical OpenAPI 3.0 specification.
*  Style guides for an internal audience on a variety of writing use cases.
